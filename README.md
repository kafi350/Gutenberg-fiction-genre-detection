# Gutenberg-fiction-genre-detection
Different features are extracted from Gutenberg fictions and those are used for predicting the genre of the fictions. I have used sentence length, pos tagging and tf-idf as the features and used machine learning algo such as Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest.
