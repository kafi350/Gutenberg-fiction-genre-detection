# Gutenberg-fiction-genre-detection
Different features are extracted from Gutenberg fictions and those are used for predicting the genre of the fictions. I have used sentence length, pos tagging and tf-idf as the features and used machine learning algo such as Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest. 


The data set is created from Project Gutenberg 2. The data set consists of about 1000 books and roughly 10 genres. The task here consists of detection (i.e. classification) of genre3 of a book. Each
data-point in this classification task is a fiction book with a label (genre). 

1) Extracted features that are relevant to fiction books, which may include ideas like sentiment, settings and so on, using appropriate libraries if possible. You cannot hand-in a solution with bag-of-words or simple term incidences, as your feature
representation.
2) Outlined which models were used why and how model selection was performed.
3) The evaluation of the model is being done.
